## What is rpc-core?

Rpc-core is a library for end-to-end typesafe communication.
It is inspired by [tRPC](https://github.com/trpc/trpc), but with a focus on modularity and ability to define schema and implement it separately.

### Features
- ‚õëÔ∏è Complete type safety for all operations, their inputs and return values.
- üíª You can easily create multiple schemas for your operations and then merge them into one.
- üëÄ Support for subscriptions
- üîãBatteries included - includes adapters for your favorite frameworks, such as React.js, Next, Vue and more

## Install

With pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @theunderscorer/rpc-core
```

With npm:

```bash
npm install @theunderscorer/rpc-core
```

## Usage
```ts
import { defineSchema, RpcClient } from "@theunderscorer/rpc-core";
import { createHttpClientLink } from "@theunderscorer/rpc-http-link";
import { z } from "zod";

const schema = defineSchema({
  queries: {
    greet: query()
      .withPayload(
        z.object({
          name: z.string()
        })
      )
      .withResult(z.string())
  }
});

async function main() {
  const httpLink = createHttpClientLink({
    url: "http://localhost:3000/api"
  });
  const client = new RpcClient(schema, [httpLink]);

  // Querying the greeting
  const response = await client.query("greet", {
    name: "John"
  });

  console.log("response", response); // Hello John
}

```
